Blackjack (in Python 3.7)

This is the README for the console based program blackjack written by David Wu (dwwu16@stanford.edu). Unless stated in the introduction section, all rules to this game are standard blackjack rules (see wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). Changes to the rules are as follows: you can hit as many times as you want after splitting aces. 

To run a game of blackjack, simply run the script play_blackjack.py and enjoy!

An explanation of design choices, testing conditions, and general rationale can be found in explanation.txt.
